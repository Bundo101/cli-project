# Cli::Project Detailing The Worst Movies Ever

This program scrapes an article on the Business Insider website that lists the 75 worst movies of all time according to the aggregated crictic scores on Metacritic.com, and if the user wants to read full details on that movie it then scrapes Metacritic for that movie's data and displays it.
